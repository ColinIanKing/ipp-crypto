Functions based on SM2
======================


Short Description


This section describes functions based on the SM2 encryption standard
for elliptic curves. For more information on the Elliptic Curve
Integrated Encryption Scheme, see [`IEEE
P1363A <bibliography.html>`__]. The
standard operations of GFpEC functions are listed below:


-  Compute a shared secret Z of the private key U and a recipient public
   key W.


-  Derive a shared secret key data K from the shared secret Z.


-  Encrypt or decrypt a message using the cipher agreed upon parties and
   the shared secret key data K.


-  Compute an authentication tag using the agreed authentication scheme
   and the secret key data K.


As an encryption or decryption result, the Elliptic Curve Encryption
Scheme (ECES) returns a buffer with the following components:

* pk containing representation of the sender public key;
*  msg containing the encrypted or decrypted message;
*  tag containing the authentication tag.


The size of msg equals to the size of the plain-text message. To get the
size of pk or tag, call the
`ippsGFpECESGetBuffersSize_SM2 <gfpecesgetbuffersize_sm2.html>`__
function.


For more information on the SM2 cryptographic algorithm based on
elliptic curves, see [`SM2
PKE <bibliography.html>`__].
