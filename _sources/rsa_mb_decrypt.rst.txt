Parameters

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     pPtxts[8]   
     -  Pointer to the IppsBigNumState context of the plaintext for each decryption operation.
   * -     pCtxts[8]   
     -  Pointer to the IppsBigNumState context of the ciphertext for each decryption operation.
   * -     pKeys[8]   
     -  Pointer to the IppsRSAPublicKeyState context for each decryption operation.
   * -     statuses   
     -  Pointer to the IppStatus array that contains statuses for each decryption operation.
   * -     pScratchBuffer   
     -  Pointer to the temporary buffer of size not less than returned by the `RSA_MB_GetBufferSizePrivateKey <rsa_mb_getbuffersizepublickey-rsa_mb_getbuffersizeprivatekey.html>`__ function.




Description
-----------


The function performs the RSA multi-buffer decryption operation, which
is the RSA operation on a private key. The function can perform up to 8
single RSA decryption operations at once.


Each RSA decryption operation requires valid parameters that follow the
`ippsRSA_Decrypt <rsa_decrypt.html>`__
syntax. After execution, the statuses array contains statuses for each
single RSA decryption operation returned by
`ippsRSA_Decrypt <rsa_decrypt.html>`__
.


To perform less than 8 operations, set one or more contexts in arrays to
NULL. In this case, all single operations with NULL in parameters are
not performed, and the function returns ippStsMbWarning .


.. note::


   .. rubric:: Important
      :class: NoteTipHead

   Sizes of all moduli ``n`` in all the IppsRSAPrivateKeyState contexts
   in the pKeys array must be equal. Types of RSA private keys must be
   the same.


Return Values
-------------


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     ippStsNoErr   
     -     Indicates no error. All single operations are executed without errors. Any other value indicates an error or warning.   
   * -     ippStsNullPtrErr   
     -     Indicates an error condition if any of the specified pointers is NULL .    
   * -     ippStsSizeErr   
     -     Indicates an error condition if the size of modulus ``n`` in one context is not equal to the size of the modulus ``n`` in other contexts.    
   * -     ippStsBadArgErr   
     -     Indicates an error condition if types of RSA private keys are not the same.   
   * -     ippStsMbWarning   
     -     Indicates a warning when one or more performed operations are executed with errors. For details, check the statuses array.
