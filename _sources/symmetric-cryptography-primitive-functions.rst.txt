Symmetric Cryptography Primitive Functions
==========================================


In the context of secure data communication, symmetric cryptography
primitive functions protect messages transferred over open communication
media by offering adequate security strength to meet application
security requirement, as well as algorithmic efficiency to enable secure
communication in real time.


Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP) Cryptography
offers operations using the following symmetric cryptography algorithms:


-  Block ciphers: Rijndael
   [`AES <bibliography.html>`__],
   including AES-CCM [`NIST SP
   800-38C <bibliography.html>`__]
   and AES-GCM [`NIST SP
   800-38D <bibliography.html>`__],
   Triple DES (TDES) [`FIPS PUB
   46-3 <bibliography.html>`__],
   and SMS4
   [`SM4 <bibliography.html>`__].
-  Stream ciphers: ARCFour
   [`AC <bibliography.html>`__],
   producing the same encryption/decryption as the RC4\* proprietary
   cipher of RSA Security Inc.
