PKCS V1.5 Encryption Scheme Functions
=====================================


.. note::


   This algorithm is considered weak due to known attacks on it. The
   functionality remains in the library, but the implementation will no
   longer be optimized and no security patches will be applied. A more
   secure alternative is available: RSA-OAEP. For more information, see
   *PKCS #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard*
   (http://www.di-srv.unisa.it/~ads/corso-security/www/CORSO-9900/oracle/pkcsv21.pdf).


This subsection describes functions implementing encryption schemes
defined in version 1.5 of the PKCS#1 standard ([`PKCS
1.2.1 <bibliography.html>`__]).
