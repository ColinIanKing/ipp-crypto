Message Authentication Functions
================================


Hash function-based MAC (HMAC) is widely used in the applications
requiring message authentication and data integrity check. HMAC was
initially put forward in [`RFC
2401 <bibliography.html>`__] and
adopted by ANSI X9.71 and [`FIPS PUB
198 <bibliography.html>`__]. See
`Keyed Hash
Functions <keyed-hash-functions.html>`__ for a
description of the Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP)
HMAC primitives.


A MAC algorithm based on a symmetric key block cipher, in other words, a
cipher-based MAC (CMAC), is standardized in [`NIST SP
800-38B <bibliography.html>`__].
CMAC may be appropriate for information systems where an approved block
cipher is available rather than an approved hash function. See `CMAC
Functions <cmac-functions.html>`__ for a
description of the Intel IPP CMAC primitives.
