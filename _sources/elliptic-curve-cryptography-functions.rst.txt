Elliptic Curve Cryptography Functions
=====================================


Cryptography Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP)
Cryptography offers functions allowing for different operations with an
elliptic curve defined over a prime finite field GF(*p*).


The functions are based on standards [`IEEE
P1363A <bibliography.html>`__],
[`SEC1 <bibliography.html>`__],
[`ANSI <bibliography.html>`__], and
[`SM2 <bibliography.html>`__].


Intel IPP Cryptography supports some elliptic curves with fixed
parameters, the so-called standard or recommended curves. These
parameters are chosen so that they provide a sufficient level of
security and enable efficient implementation.
