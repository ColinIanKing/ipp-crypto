Parameters
----------


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * - pEC   
     - Pointer to the context of the elliptic curve




Description
-----------


The functions ECCPValidate, ECCPGenKeyPair and ECCPVerify perform
time-consuming math operations on the elliptic curve base point. In
Intel IPP Cryptography-supported standards, the base point is fixed, and
you may use pre-computed values.


The function ECCPBindGxyTbl stores a pointer the to the pre-computed
base point data in the elliptic curve context. For performance-critical
applications, consider calling ECCPBindGxyTbl at the completion of
elliptic curve initialization. The use of ECCPBindGxyTbl improves the
performance of ECCPValidate, ECCPGenKeyPair and ECCPVerify up to 2
times.


.. note::


   The size of the pre-computed table is quite large (~100-150KB), so
   using ECCPBindGxyTbl increases the size of your application.


.. note::


   .. rubric:: Important
      :class: NoteTipHead

   The set of ECCPBindGxyTbl functions covers only curves defined by the
   following standards: NIST P-192r1, NIST P-224r1, NIST P-256r1, NIST
   P-384r1, NIST P521r1, and SM2. Other standard elliptic curves
   supported in Intel IPP Cryptography do not have a similar mechanism
   because they do not match modern security strength requirements.


Return Values
-------------


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * - ippsStsNoErr   
     - Indicates no error. Any other message indicates an error or warning.
   * - ippsStsNullPtrErr   
     - Indicates an error condition if pEC is NULL.
   * - ippsStsContextMatchErr   
     - Indicates an error condition if the elliptic curve context is not valid.
