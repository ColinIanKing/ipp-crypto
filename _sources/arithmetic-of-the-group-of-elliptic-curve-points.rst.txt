Arithmetic of the Group of Elliptic Curve Points
================================================


This section describes the Intel IPP functions that implement arithmetic
operations with points of elliptic curves
[`EC <bibliography.html>`__]. The
elliptic curve is defined by the following equation:


``y``\ :sup:`2` = ``x``\ :sup:`3` + ``A`` â‹… ``x`` + ``B``


where

*  ``A`` and ``B`` are the parameters of the curve
*  ``x`` and ``y`` are the coordinates of a point on the curve


This document considers elliptic curves constructed over the finite
field GF(``p``) (prime or its extension), therefore the arithmetic of
elliptic curves is based on the arithmetic of the underlying finite
field. In the equation above, ``A, B, x,`` and ``y`` belong to the
underlying field GF(``p``).
