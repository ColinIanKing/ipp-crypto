Parameters

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     pMsgs[8]   
     -  Pointer to the array of messages that have been signed.
   * -     msgLens[8]   
     -  Pointer to the array of messages lengths.
   * -     pSignts[8]   
     -  Pointer to the array of signatures to be verified.
   * -     pIsValid   
     -  Pointer to the array of verification results.
   * -     pPubKeys[8]   
     -  Pointer to the array of preliminary initialized IppsRSAPublicKeyState contexts.
   * -     pMethod   
     -  Pointer to the hash method. For details, see `HashMethod <hashmethod.html>`__ functions.
   * -     statuses[8]   
     -  Pointer to the array of execution statuses for each performed operation.
   * -     pBuffer   
     -  Pointer to a temporary buffer. The size of the buffer must be not less than the value returned by the `RSA_MB_GetBufferSizePublicKey <rsa_mb_getbuffersizepublickey-rsa_mb_getbuffersizeprivatekey.html>`__ function.




Description
-----------


This function carries out the RSASSA-PSS signature verification scheme
defined in [ `PKCS
1.2.1 <bibliography.html>`__ ]. The
function can perform up to 8 verification operations at once.


Specify parameters for each single signature verification operation
under the corresponding index in an input array in accordance with the
`ippsRSAVerify_PSS_rmf <rsaverify_pss.html>`__
function API requirements.


To perform less than 8 operations, set one or more pointers to a context
in input context arrays to NULL. In this case, each single operation
with the context set to NULL will not be performed, and the function
will return ippStsMbWarning . Once the function execution is completed,
the statuses array will contain return codes for each single signature
verification operation according to the
`ippsRSAVerify_PSS_rmf <rsaverify_pss.html>`__
return values.


.. note::


   .. rubric:: Important
      :class: NoteTipHead

   -  Sizes of all moduli ``n`` in all IppsRSAPublicKeyState contexts in
      the pPubKeys array must be equal.


   -  Sizes and values of all public exponents ``e`` in all
      IppsRSAPublicKeyState contexts in the pPubKeys array must be
      equal.


Return Values
-------------


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     ippStsNoErr   
     -     Indicates no error. All single operations executed without errors. Any other value indicates an error or warning.   
   * -     ippStsMbWarning   
     -     One or more of performed operations executed with error. Check statuses array for details.   
   * -     ippStsNullPtrErr   
     -     Any of the input parameters is a NULL pointer.   
   * -     ippStsSizeErr   
     -     Indicates a mismatch between moduli ``n`` sizes in the input contexts.    
   * -     ippStsBadArgErr   
     -     Indicates a mismatch between exponents ``e`` in public keys.    
   * -     ippStsContextMatchErr   
     -     No valid keys were found.
