Developer Reference for Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography
=============================================================================


`What's New <what's-new.html>`__


The Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP) is a software
library that provides a comprehensive set of application domain-specific
highly optimized functions for signal and image processing and
cryptography.


.. note::


   This publication, the *Developer Reference for Intel Integrated
   Performance Primitives Cryptography*, was previously known as the
   *Cryptography for Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Reference
   Manual*.


Intel IPP Cryptography is an add-on library that offers Intel IPP users
a cross-platform and cross operating system application programming
interface (API) for routines commonly used for cryptographic operations.
Among other features, the library includes:


RSA Algorithm Functions
-----------------------


`RSA Algorithm
Functions <rsa-algorithm-functions.html>`__ implement
the non-symmetric RSA algorithm. Subsections include reference for
different encryption schemes and RSA system building functions.


Rijndael Functions
------------------


`Rijndael Functions <rijndael-functions.html>`__
implement the symmetric iterated Rijndael block cipher with variable key
and block sizes. The Rijndael cipher with 128 bit block size is also
known as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher.


Mask Generation Functions
-------------------------


A Mask Generation Function takes a string of arbitrary length and
deterministically outputs a pseudorandom string of desired length. `Mask
Generation Functions <mask-generation-functions.html>`__
are used in different cryptographic algorithms, including some RSA
encryption schemes.


AES-CCM Functions
-----------------


`AES-CCM Functions <aes-ccm-functions.html>`__
are an implementation of the Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message
Authentication Code (CCM) mode of operation of the AES cipher.


AES-GCM Functions
-----------------


`AES-GCM Functions <aes-gcm-functions.html>`__
implement the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation of the AES block
cipher. GCM is an authenticated encryption algorithm, which allows you
to verify the integrity of encrypted data.
