Hash Functions for Non-Streaming Messages
=========================================


This section describes functions that calculate a digest of an entire
(non-streaming) input message by applying a selected hash algorithm, as
well as a possibility to use a different implementation of a hash
algorithm.

   The crypto community does not consider SHA-1 or MD5 algorithms secure
   anymore.


   Recommendation: use a more secure hash algorithm (for example, any
   algorithm from the SHA-2 family) instead of SHA-1 or MD5.
