This document describes the structure, operation, and functions of
Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP) Cryptography. The
document provides a background for cryptography concepts used in the
Intel IPP Cryptography software as well as detailed description of the
respective Intel IPP Cryptography functions. The Intel IPP Cryptography
functions are combined in groups by their functionality. Each group of
functions is described in a separate section.
