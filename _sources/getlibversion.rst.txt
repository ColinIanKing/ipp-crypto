.. _getlibversion:



GetLibVersion
=============


Returns information about the active version of the Intel IPP software
for cryptography.


Syntax
------


const IppLibraryVersion\* ippcpGetLibVersion(void);


Include Files
-------------


``ippcp.h``


Description
-----------


This function returns a pointer to a static data structure
IppLibraryVersion that contains information about the current version of
the Intel IPP software for cryptography. There is no need for you to
release memory referenced by the returned pointer because it points to a
static variable. The following fields of the IppLibraryVersion structure
are available:


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * - major   
     - is the major number of the current library version.
   * - minor   
     - is the minor number of the current library version.
   * - majorBuild   
     - is the number of builds for the (major.miror) version.
   * - build   
     - is the total number of Intel IPP builds.
   * - Name   
     - is the name of the current library version.
   * - Version   
     - is the version string.
   * - BuildDate   
     - is the actual build date




For example, if the library version is "7.0", library name is
"ippcp.lib", and build date is "Jul 20 2011", then the fields in this
structure are set as follows:


major = 7, minor = 0, Name = "ippcp_l.lib", Version = "7.0 build
205.68", BuildDate = "Jul 20 2011".


Example
-------


The code example below shows how to use the function ippcpGetLibVersion.


.. code-block:: cpp


   void libinfo(void) { const IppLibraryVersion* lib = ippcpGetLibVersion();


.. code-block:: cpp


   printf("%s %s %d.%d.%d.%d\n", lib->Name, lib->Version, lib->major, lib->minor, lib->majorBuild, lib->build);


.. code-block:: cpp


   }


.. code-block:: cpp


Output:


``ippcp_l.lib 7.0 build 205.68``
