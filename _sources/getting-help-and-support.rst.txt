Getting Help and Support
========================


Getting Technical Support
-------------------------


If you did not register your Intel software product during installation,
please do so now at the IntelÂ® Software Development Products
Registration Center. Registration entitles you to free technical
support, product updates and upgrades for the duration of the support
term.


For general information about Intel technical support, product updates,
user forums, FAQs, tips and tricks and other support questions, please
visit http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/ and the Intel IPP
forum
http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-integrated-performance-primitives/.


.. note::


   If your distributor provides technical support for this product,
   please contact them rather than Intel.
